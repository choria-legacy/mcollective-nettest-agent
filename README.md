## Overview

This is a simple agent that will execute a ping or remote connection test on mcollective hosts

I often find myself logging onto boxes to ping different sites to diagnose local or remote network issues, this means I can now just issue a single command and get results from anywhere Iâ€™m running mcollective.

Installation
------------

* Install RubyGem [Net::Ping](http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/net-ping/)
* Follow the [basic plugin install guide](http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/mcollective-plugins/wiki/InstalingPlugins)

Usage
-----

ICMP ping test:

    $ mco nettest ping hostname
    Do you really want to perform network tests unfiltered? (y/n): y

    Finished processing 11 / 11 hosts in 85.76 ms

TCP connection test to port 8140:

    $ mco nettest connect hostname 8140

Validator
---------

The nettest agent supplies an fqdn validator which will validate if a string is a valid uri.

    validate :fqdn, :nettest_fqdn

The nettest agent supplies a server address validator which will validate that a given string includes both a valid hostname and port number separated by a colon.

    validate :serveraddress, :nettest_server_address

Data Plugin
-----------

The nettest agent also supplies a data plugin which uses the nettest agent to check if a connection to a fqdn at a specific port can be made. The data plugin will return 'true' or 'false' and can be used during discovery or any other place where the MCollective discovery language is used.

    $ mco rpc rpcutil -S "Nettest('myhost', '8080').connect=true"

Mma Aggregate Plugin
--------------------

The nettest agent supplies a mma aggregate plugin which will determine the minimum value, maximum value and average value of a set of inputs determinted in a DDL.

    summarize do
      aggregate nettest_mma(:rtt, :format => "Min: %.3fms  Max: %.3fms  Average: %.3fms")
    end
